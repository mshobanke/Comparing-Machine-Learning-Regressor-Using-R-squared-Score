# Evaluating Machine Learning Regressors Using R-squared Score
The aim of this task is to evaluate and compare the prediction output of 5 machine learning regressors , using R-squared score. R-squared score represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. Higher R-squared scores indicate better fit by the models.

The dependent variable is given as PE: Energy Output.

The independent variables are as shown below:
1. AT = Engine Temperature
2. V = Exhaust vacuum
3. AP = Ambient Pressure
4. RH = Relative Humidity

Kindly note that the dataset used for this task is clean. As a result, data preprocessing is not required.

Below is a list of machine learning regressors used to carry out this task:
1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Linear Regression
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. Decision Tree Regressor
5. Support Vector Regressor.
